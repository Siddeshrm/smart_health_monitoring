# smart_health_monitoring
tâ€™s an IoT-based wearable/portable system that continuously monitors a personâ€™s vital health parameters (like heart rate, body temperature, pulse rate) along with location tracking (GPS). Using LoRa (Long Range) communication, the collected data can be transmitted over several kilometers to a central monitoring system 



This system is particularly useful in remote health monitoring, elderly care, patient tracking, emergency response, and even soldier health tracking in defense applications.

ðŸ”¹ Core Components

Sensors

Heart Rate & Pulse Sensor (MAX30100 / MAX30102 / Pulse Sensor) â€“ Detects heartbeat and pulse rate.

Temperature Sensor (LM35 / DS18B20 / MLX90614) â€“ Measures body temperature.

Optional: SpO2 Sensor â€“ Oxygen saturation in blood.

GPS Module (NEO-6M / NEO-M8N)

Provides real-time latitude and longitude for location tracking.

LoRa Module (SX1278 / RFM95W)

Sends health + GPS data wirelessly over 2â€“10 km range (depends on environment).

Works on low power, making it good for wearable devices.

Microcontroller

ESP32 / Arduino + LoRa shield / STM32 â€“ Collects sensor data, processes it, and transmits via LoRa.

Gateway/Receiver

Another LoRa + MCU setup connected to a PC, Raspberry Pi, or cloud server to collect data.

Dashboard / Mobile App

Displays real-time health readings + location map.

Alerts in case of abnormal values (high fever, irregular heartbeat, SOS).

ðŸ”¹ Working Principle

Data Acquisition â€“ Sensors measure heart rate, pulse, and body temperature.

Processing â€“ Microcontroller processes signals and prepares them in a structured packet.

Localization â€“ GPS adds latitude & longitude.

Transmission â€“ LoRa sends data to a remote gateway.

Monitoring â€“ Data is displayed on a web app/mobile dashboard.

Alerts â€“ Threshold-based alarms (e.g., if HR > 120 bpm or Temp > 38Â°C).

ðŸ”¹ Applications

âœ… Healthcare â€“ Remote monitoring of patients, elderly, or post-surgery care.
âœ… Military â€“ Track soldiersâ€™ health + location in remote areas.
âœ… Disaster Management â€“ Monitor health of rescue workers in real-time.
âœ… Sports & Fitness â€“ Athlete health tracking in outdoor training.
âœ… Rural Areas â€“ Where WiFi/4G is not available, LoRa provides long-distance health data transmission.

ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case

Imagine a patient in a rural village wearing this kit:

Sensors record heart rate = 85 bpm, Temp = 37.2Â°C

GPS adds Lat: 12.9716, Long: 77.5946

Data is sent via LoRa â†’ Gateway â†’ Cloud server

Doctor in the city can view readings in real time.

If patientâ€™s heart rate crosses 150 bpm â†’ system sends emergency alert + GPS location to doctor and family.

## 4. Example Data Packet (JSON)

```json
{
  "device_id": "KIT_001",
  "ts": "2025-09-10T06:30:12Z",
  "gps": {"lat": 12.9716, "lon": 77.5946, "fix": true},
  "heart_rate": 86,
  "pulse": 86,
  "temperature_c": 37.2,

* Battery: < 3.3V â†’ Low battery alert

---

## 6. Recommended Modules & Notes

* **MCU**: ESP32 (has BLE/Wiâ€‘Fi for local provisioning and plenty of compute)
* **LoRa**: RFM95W / SX1278 (check local frequencies: 868MHz EU, 915MHz US/IN)
* **GPS**: NEO-6M (cheap), NEO-M8N (better performance)
* **Sensors**: MAX30102 (heart + SpO2), DS18B20 (temp probe) or MLX90614 (non-contact)
* **Power**: 3.7V Li-ion 500â€“1500 mAh with boost/regulator (include low-power sleep modes)

---

## 7. Power & Duty Cycle Suggestions

* Sample HR/Temp every 10â€“30s in normal mode; increase frequency when anomaly detected.
* Use deep sleep on ESP32 between samples; wake for GPS fix intermittently (or use assisted GPS strategy).
* LoRa: keep payload small; use ACKs only for critical packets.

---

## 8. Dashboard Features

* Real-time line charts for HR & Temp
* Map with last known location + breadcrumb trail
* Device list with battery and connection status
* Alerts timeline & SMS/push integration
* Export CSV and historical charts (20â€“100 sample history)

---

## 9. Prototype PCB & Enclosure Tips

* Separate sensor header for easy replacement
* Shield GPS antenna from metal; provide clear antenna window
* Add 2â€“3 LEDs for status (power, LoRa TX, GPS fix)
* Use small form factor (wrist strap or chest patch) depending on sensor placement

---

## 10. Next Steps (if you want)

* I can create: 1) a wiring schematic, 2) Arduino/ESP32 prototype code with LoRa packet send, or 3) a sample web dashboard mockup. Tell me which one to build next.

*Document created for you â€” edit or request the next artifact (schematic, code, dashboard) and Iâ€™ll add it.*
